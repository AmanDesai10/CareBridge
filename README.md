## Project Description

The project CareBridge is a mobile application that aims to bridge the gap between the elderly and their family members. The app has 3 modules:
Family and Friends Module, Senior Citizen Module, and Volunteer Module.

The application is designed to provide a platform for the elderly to connect with their family members and caregivers. The senior citizens can add their daily needs, such as medication reminders, doctor appointments, and grocery lists, to the application. The family members get notified about these needs and can help the elderly with their daily tasks.

The family members can also create a profile for the elderly or connect with the elderly using an email. The application also has Fall Detection and Emergency Alert features that can be used by the elderly in case of an emergency. The app sends a notification along with the location of the elderly to the family members upon detection of fall.

The application also has a Volunteer Module that allows volunteers to connect with the elderly and help them with their daily tasks. The volunteers can share their availability based on which the family/senior citizen member can book an appointment with the volunteer.
